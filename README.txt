I am not responisable for any damages for using this virus. To run the virus, please double-click on Photo-of-a-.bat file in the directory this file is in. Please use this virus legally and don't spread it without permission (your friends won't like it). This virus should probably kill antiviruses, so don't think they are safe. You can do antivirues tests, but remeber, only on a VM! Enjoy!
